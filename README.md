# HypixelBot

A Hypixel Discord Bot made purely for displaying Hypixel statistics.

To run this bot, change `<TOKEN>` in `config.ini` to your Discord Bot Token, which can be retrieved from your Discord Developer Portal.
`<API KEY>` will also need to be changed to your Hypixel API Key, which can be created by connecting to the Minecraft server `mc.hypixel.net` and running the `/api new` command. 

If you wish, you may also change `<LOG CHANNEL ID>` in `config.ini` to a Discord channel ID. Bot events, errors, etc will be sent to the specified channel.

This bot retrieves statistics from the official public [Hypixel API](https://api.hypixel.net). Documentation for the API can be found [here](https://github.com/HypixelDev/PublicAPI/tree/master/Documentation).
