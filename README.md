A Hypixel Discord Bot made purely for displaying Hypixel statistics.

To run this bot, change `<TOKEN>` in `botconfig.ini` to your Discord Bot Token, which can be retrieved from your Discord Developer Portal, and change `<API KEY>`, also in `botconfig.ini` to your Hypixel API Key, which can be created by connecting to mc.hypixel.net and running the `/api new` command.

This bot retrieves statistics from the official public [Hypixel API](https://api.hypixel.net). Documentation for the API can be found [here](https://github.com/HypixelDev/PublicAPI/tree/master/Documentation).

Thanks to [@DimBis](https://dimmy.xyz) for helping me with this project.

This bot is currently in development, there may be some bugs.
